This guide provides common troubleshooting steps for issues encountered when using the Technical Writer Tasks API.
1. Authentication Issues
❌ Problem: 401 Unauthorized

Error Message:

{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "API key is missing or invalid."
}

Possible Causes & Solutions:

    Missing API Key: Ensure you include the X-API-KEY header in your request.
    Invalid API Key: Double-check that your API key is correct and active.
    Incorrect Header Name: The API key must be passed using X-API-KEY, not Authorization.
    Key Expired or Revoked: Contact the API provider to verify your API key status.

Example of a Correct Header:

X-API-KEY: your_api_key_here


Request Format Errors
❌ Problem: 400 Bad Request

Error Message:

{
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "The request body is malformed or missing required fields."
}

Possible Causes & Solutions:

    Missing Required Fields: Ensure the request includes all required fields.
    Incorrect Data Types: Verify that the data matches the API schema.
    Malformed JSON: Use a JSON validator to check the request body.

Example of a Correct Request Body (POST /tasks):

{
  "title": "Draft User Guide",
  "description": "Create the initial draft of the user guide.",
  "status": "OPEN",
  "component": "HELP_CENTER",
  "connected_tasks": []
}

Server Issues
❌ Problem: 500 Internal Server Error

Error Message:

{
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "message": "An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."
}

Possible Causes & Solutions:

    Temporary Server Downtime: Wait a few minutes and retry the request.
    Rate Limiting: Too many requests in a short time may trigger rate limits. Implement a delay between requests.
    API Bug: If the issue persists, contact the API provider.

Rate Limiting
❌ Problem: 429 Too Many Requests

Error Message:

{
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again later."
}

Possible Causes & Solutions:

    Exceeding Request Limits: Reduce the frequency of API calls.
    Implementing Rate Limit Handling: Use exponential backoff for retries.

Example of Exponential Backoff (Python):

import time
import requests

url = "https://api.techwriter.xyz/tasks"
headers = {"X-API-KEY": "your_api_key_here"}

for attempt in range(5):
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    
    if response.status_code == 429:
        wait_time = (2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
        print(f"Rate limited. Retrying in {wait_time} seconds...")
        time.sleep(wait_time)
    else:
        break
